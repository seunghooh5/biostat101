#Introduction to Biostatistics Block1

## Statistics

### Definition

"Statistics" is an inclusive term describing the...

* Collection
* Organization
* Analysis
* Interpretation

of **DATA** to answer questions and make decisions.

### Sample = Subset

A subset ('sample') of the larger population is studied in depth to gain information, which is then inferred back to the population as a whole.

### Avoiding bias

* Ideally, a sample should be _representative_ of the population as a whole.
* **_Representative_**: what is true of the population is also true of the sample.
* This is more likely to happen if sampling process is free of bias.
